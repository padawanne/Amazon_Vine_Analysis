# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Project Overview
Performing an analysis on an AWS dataset containing customers reviews on Baby products sold on Amazon. 
Some of these reviews were received under the Vine Program, which is a paid program.
This analysis is to see if there is a rating difference between customers rating products under this program and regular customers. 

## Results of the analysis
463 reviews were made under the Vine program. Among those 463 reviews, 202 were 5 star reviews, or 44%.
25,094 reviews were made by regular customers (therefore; unpaid reviews). Among those, 12,033 were 5 star reviews, or 48%. 
According to these numbers, customers don't seem to be influenced or biased in favour of the product while being under the Vine program. To prove this further, it would be interesting to compare other reviews (1, 2, 3 and 4 star reviews) and see if there is a similar difference.
